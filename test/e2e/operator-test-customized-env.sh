 USAGE=" 
 Usage: 
   $(basename "$0")

   This script will run the preflight binary against an operator test. To be used in e2e testing.
   
   Environment variables required by preflight that are not otherwise reflected here are still
   required (e.g. KUBECONFIG), and must be set in the environment prior to running this script.
  
 Environment variables: 
   PREFLIGHT_BIN:           Specify the path to the compiled preflight binary.
                            If this is not provided, this script will execute the
                            preflight binary relative to the current working directory.
                            Default: "./$DEFAULT_PREFLIGHT_BIN"
   OPERATOR_BUNDLE:         Specify the registry path of the operator bundle under test.
                            Default: $DEFAULT_OPERATOR_BUNDLE
   OPERATOR_INDEXIMAGE      Specify the index image containing the operator bundle under
                            test.
                            Default: $DEFAULT_OPERATOR_INDEXIMAGE
