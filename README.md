# Preflight

**Preflight** is a commandline interface for validating if
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) operator bundles and containers meet minimum
requirements for [Red Hat OpenShift
Certification](https://connect.redhat.com/en/partner-with-us/red-hat-openshift-certification).

This project is in active and rapid development! Many facets of this project are
subject to change, and some features are not fully implemented.

## Requirements

The preflight binary currently requires that you have the following tools installed,
functional, and in your path.

| Name             | Tool cli          | Minimum version |
|----------------- |:-----------------:| ---------------:|
| OperatorSDK      | `operator-sdk`    | v1.14.0         |
| OpenShift Client | `oc`              | v4.7.19         |

See our [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) for more information on setting up a
development environment. Some checks may also require access to an OpenShift
cluster. which is not provided by the Vagrantfile

## Usage

The `preflight` utility allows one to confirm that container and Operator projects
comply with container and Operator certification policies.

A brief summary of the available sub-commands is as follows:

```text
A utility that allows you to pre-test your bundles, operators, and container before submitting for Red Hat Certification.

Usage:
  preflight [command]

Available Commands:
  certify     Submits check results to Red Hat
  check       Run checks for an operator or container
  help        Help about any command
  support     Submits a support request

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for preflight
  -v, --version   version for preflight

Use "preflight [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

To check a container, utilize the `check container` sub-command:

```text
preflight check container quay.io/example-namespace/example-container:0.0.1
```

To check an Operator bundle, utilize the `check Operator` sub-command:

```text
preflight check operator quay.io/example-namespace/example-operator:0.0.1
```

For more detailed usage examples, see [Recipes](docs/RECIPES.md).

[CONFIG](docs/CONFIG.md)

### Authenticating to Registries

The `preflight` command will automatically utilize a credential file at
`$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json` (default: `~/.docker/config.json`) to access images
in private registries.

#### Remote Checks

In some cases (e.g. *DeployableByOLM*), `preflight` will also pass credentials
to the cluster used for testing (i.e. the cluster that is accessible through the
current-context of the provided `KUBECONFIG`).

We anticipate that the credentials in `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json` may contain
more access than what is needed for `preflight` execution. To avoid passing more
credentials than needed into a cluster for those checks, `preflight` will also
accept a full path to a dockerconfigjson that should be passed through to a
remote cluster via the `PFLT_DOCKERCONFIG` environment variable.

If this variable is unset, `preflight` will assume that the images in scope
(e.g. PFLT_INDEXIMAGE value, and the test target itself) are already accessible
from the cluster used for testing.

#### Podman Users

[Podman](https://podman.io/) stores credentials at
`${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`, which can also be used by executing
the following:

```shell
ln -sf ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/config.json
DOCKER_CONFIG=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers
```

## Installation

Before installing `preflight`, ensure that the [required dependencies](#requirements) have been installed on the local machine.

### Install Prebuilt Release

One of the prebuilt [release binaries][releases_link] for the supported
architectures can be downloaded and installed to the local machine.

### Install From Source

Once the repository has been cloned locally, the `preflight` binary can be built
from source by using the provided target from within the root of the project directory.

```bash
make build
```

The `preflight` binary will be created in the root of the project directory. The
binary can then be copied manually to a location in the local `$PATH`.

```bash
sudo mv preflight /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify that the `preflight` binary can run successfully.

```bash
preflight --version
```

The version information should be displayed.

```bash
preflight version 0.0.0 <commit: 2d3bb671bff8a95d385621382f31215234877d44>
```

## Preflight Testing

For e2e testing, run

```bash
go test -v ./test/e2e/
```

or run

```bash
make test-e2e
```

For unit testing, run

```bash
go test -v `go list ./... | grep -v e2e`
```

or run

```bash
make test
```
